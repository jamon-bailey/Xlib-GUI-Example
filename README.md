    <h1>Cross-Platform C/C++ Template</h1>
</div></br>

<div> <!--| Template Style Introduction |-->
    <h3>:: API Style</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>API style</strong> project directory is designed for <strong>writing libraries intended to be consumed by other developers</strong>. Unlike end-user applications, a library's project structure is part of its public interface and consequently the user experience. Downstream projects interact not only with its binaries and headers but also with its build system and dependency layout. The goal this template has in mind is providing new projects with a conforming starting point that is easy to consume, extend, and maintain; whether linking it via CMake, embedding it directly, or publishing it as a package.
    </p>
    <p>
        In contrast, <strong>End-User style</strong> projects typically focus on producing standalone executables or tools where internal organization is flexible and developer-facing ergonomics are less critical. You can find this template on the <a href="https://github.com/InfinSys/xplatform-cpp/tree/end-user-style">End-User Style branch</a>.

<div> <!--| Template Setup Instructions |-->
    <h2>Project Template Setup</h2>
    <h4>Clone this repository using the CLI:</h4>
    <pre align="center"><code>git clone https://github.com/InfinSys/xplatform-cpp.git -b api-style [destination path]</code></pre>
    <strong><h3 align="center">OR</h3></strong>
    <h4 align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/InfinSys/xplatform-cpp/archive/refs/heads/api-style.zip">📂download the source ZIP file</a> and extract it to a preferred location.
    </h4></br>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <p>
        Once you obtain the template you can proceed with your modifications. There are conveniently placed <code>TODO:</code> markers within the project files that point out some critical personalization points if you are unsure where to start.
    </p>
    <h3>You are encouraged to modify this template as much as you desire, make it yours!</h3>
    <p>(<em>More details on project structure <a href="#-this-readme-is-still-in-progress-">below</a></em>)</p></br>
    <p>
        When you are ready to build the project, <em>or if you'd like to verify the template works straight out of the box</em>, you can instruct CMake to create the necessary build system files for your generator with the following:
    </p>
    <h3>🔧 Run the CMake configuration:</h3>
    <p>(<em>in the root directory of the template</em>)</p>
    <blockquote>
        <h3>Windows (x64):</h3>
        <pre><code>cmake --preset win32-x64-debug</code></pre>
        <h3>Linux (x64):</h3>
        <pre><code>cmake --preset linux-x64-debug</code></pre>
        <h3>macOS (x64):</h3>
        <pre><code>cmake --preset macos-x64-debug</code></pre>
    </blockquote></br>
</div>

        Configuring the project results in a <code>build</code> folder appearing in the project root that contains a subdirectory
        specific to your preset. Because this template makes use of CMake presets, it is not necessary to navigate to the
        build directory before invoking the CMake build command:
    </p>
    <h3>🔨 Build your project with CMake:</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <h3>Windows:</h3>
        <pre><code>cmake --build --preset win32-x64-debug</code></pre>
        <h3>Linux:</h3>
        <pre><code>cmake --build --preset linux-x64-debug</code></pre>
        <h3>macOS:</h3>
        <pre><code>cmake --build --preset macos-x64-debug</code></pre>

        <p>
            At the core of this template is CMake, serving as the primary build tool. This provides
            flexibility and control over your project's compilation, linking, and packaging across diverse platforms.
            <strong>Many of the template's features are powered directly by CMake's capabilities.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            CMake offers amazing support for various compilers, build tools, and IDEs, enabling users
            to easily swap out toolchains and target different environments without modifying source code or project files.
            This simplifies maintaining a consistent build process across Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can find
            the
            <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html">
                official CMake documentation here
